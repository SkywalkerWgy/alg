You are an expert in program verification, and please generate loop invariant as C annotation comments at the hint location (annotated by "[Hint] Please infer the loop invariant for the following loop.") using ACSL language.
ACSL is a specification language for C programs that conforms to the design by contract paradigm, utilizing Hoare style pre- and postconditions and invariants. Note that the `loop invariant` clause is a condition that is true at the beginning and end of every loop iteration.The pre- and post-conditions of functions are written as `requires` and `ensures` clauses, respectively.
In order to get a correct answer, You may want to consider both the situation of not entering the loop and the situation of jumping out of the loop. If some of the pre-conditions are also loop invariant, you need to add them to your answer as well.
Use '&&', '||', '==>', '\forall' or '\exists' if necessary. For instance:
```
loop invariant 1 <= x;
loop invariant x == y;
loop invariant 0 < x ==> y <= z;
loop invariant z % 2 == 1 || x == y;
loop invariant z % 2 == 1 && x <= y;
loop invariant \forall integer k;  0 <= k < i ==> max >=  a[k];
loop invariant \exists integer k;  0 <= k < i &&  max == a[k];
loop invariant \forall integer p; 0 <= p < \at(k, End_l) ==> res[p] == \at(res[p], End_l);
```
Your answer should follow the following format:
```
loop invariant ...;
loop invariant ...;
...
```
No explanation. No commentary. Just show me the loop invariant.

You are an expert in deductive program verification using ACSL and Frama-C.
The program has failed to prove the following `ensures` clause:
[Unproved Ensures]  x==y
To help Frama-C discharge this postcondition, you must strengthen the loop invariant of the LAST executed loop, which is the loop labeled by alphabet "A".  
You should insert additional `loop invariant` clauses only at the location marked by "[Hint] Please strengthen the loop invariant in the following loop."
IMPORTANT RULES:
1. Do NOT repeat or reprint the existing loop invariants already present in the code.
2. Your task is to provide only the new invariants that are necessary to establish the failed ensures clause.
3. The new invariants must be strong enough to imply the ensures clause upon normal loop termination.
4. All invariants you produce must satisfy:
   - Establishment: they hold on loop entry.
   - Preservation: after executing the loop body exactly once, the invariant still holds.
   - Zero-iteration case: the invariant is valid even if the loop never executes.
5. Your answer should follow the following format:
   ```
   loop invariant ...;

5. All invariants must follow ACSL syntax and be valid loop invariants.

[Unprovable Invariant] (k % 3 == 0) ==> (x == y)
The above loop invariant of loop "A" fails the preservation (inductive) condition:
after executing one iteration of the loop body, the invariant cannot be re-established.
[Loop Body]
if(k%3 == 0){ x++; y++; z++; k = x+y+z;
This failure indicates that the current invariant may be incorrect or incomplete.  
There are two typical causes:
  1) The invariant is logically incorrect, so it does not hold after the loop body executes once.
     - In this case, you must adjust the invariant so that it is preserved by the loop body.
  2) The invariant is insufficient, i.e., it misses essential supporting conditions needed to re-establish itself.
     - In this case, you must introduce additional invariants so that the whole set becomes inductive.
Your task is to produce the corrected and/or auxiliary invariants that make the preservation step succeed.
IMPORTANT RULES:
1. You MUST NOT output any of the original invariants already in the code. Only output the new or modified invariants.
2. All invariants you produce must satisfy:

You are an expert in deductive program verification using ACSL and Frama-C.
The program has failed to prove the following `ensures` clause:
[Unproved Ensures]  y==z
To help Frama-C discharge this postcondition, you must strengthen the loop invariant of the LAST executed loop, which is the loop labeled by alphabet "A".  
You should insert additional `loop invariant` clauses only at the location marked by "[Hint] Please strengthen the loop invariant in the following loop."
IMPORTANT RULES:
1. Do NOT repeat or reprint the existing loop invariants already present in the code.
2. Your task is to provide only the new invariants that are necessary to establish the failed ensures clause.
3. The new invariants must be strong enough to imply the ensures clause upon normal loop termination.
4. All invariants you produce must satisfy:
   - Establishment: they hold on loop entry.
   - Preservation: after executing the loop body exactly once, the invariant still holds.
   - Zero-iteration case: the invariant is valid even if the loop never executes.
5. Your answer should follow the following format:
   ```
   loop invariant ...;
   loop invariant ...;
   ...
   ```
5. All invariants must follow ACSL syntax and be valid loop invariants.
6. No explanation. No commentary. Just show me the loop invariant.

You are an expert in deductive program verification using ACSL and Frama-C.
The following loop invariant of the loop labeled "A" cannot be established from the function's `requires` clauses:
[Unprovable Initial Invariant] (k % 3 == 0) ==> (x == y + 1)
This means the loop invariant is too strong at the loop entry, violating the establishment condition of loop correctness.  
Your task is to relax or weaken the loop invariant at the position marked by: "[Hint] Loop invariant too strong initially. Relax it."
IMPORTANT RULES:
1. The relaxed invariants must still hold:
   - Establishment: They must be provable solely from the function's requires clauses and the program state before entering the loop.
   - Preservation: after executing the loop body exactly once, the invariant still holds.
   - Zero-iteration case: the invariant is valid even if the loop never executes.
2. Do NOT restate or print any of the existing loop invariants.  
   Only output the modified (weakened) invariants necessary to make the establishment step succeed.
3. Your answer must be solely in the form:
   ```
   loop invariant ...;
   loop invariant ...;
   ...
   ```
4. All invariants must follow ACSL syntax and be valid loop invariants.
5. No explanation. No commentary. Just show me the loop invariant.

[Unprovable Invariant] (k % 3 == 0 && k > 0) ==> (x == y + 1)
The above loop invariant of loop "A" fails the preservation (inductive) condition:
after executing one iteration of the loop body, the invariant cannot be re-established.
[Loop Body]
if(k%3 == 0){ x++; y++; z++; k = x+y+z;
This failure indicates that the current invariant may be incorrect or incomplete.  
There are two typical causes:
  1) The invariant is logically incorrect, so it does not hold after the loop body executes once.
     - In this case, you must adjust the invariant so that it is preserved by the loop body.
  2) The invariant is insufficient, i.e., it misses essential supporting conditions needed to re-establish itself.
     - In this case, you must introduce additional invariants so that the whole set becomes inductive.
Your task is to produce the corrected and/or auxiliary invariants that make the preservation step succeed.
IMPORTANT RULES:
1. You MUST NOT output any of the original invariants already in the code. Only output the new or modified invariants.
2. All invariants you produce must satisfy:
   - Establishment: they hold on loop entry.
   - Preservation: after executing the loop body exactly once, the invariant still holds.
   - Zero-iteration case: the invariant is valid even if the loop never executes.
3. The answer must follow this format exactly:
   ```

4. All invariants must follow ACSL syntax and be valid loop invariants.
