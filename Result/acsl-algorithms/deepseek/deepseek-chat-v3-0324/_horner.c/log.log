You are an expert in program verification, and please generate loop invariant as C annotation comments at the hint location (annotated by "[Hint] Please infer the loop invariant for the following loop.") using ACSL language.
ACSL is a specification language for C programs that conforms to the design by contract paradigm, utilizing Hoare style pre- and postconditions and invariants. Note that the `loop invariant` clause is a condition that is true at the beginning and end of every loop iteration.The pre- and post-conditions of functions are written as `requires` and `ensures` clauses, respectively.
In order to get a correct answer, You may want to consider both the situation of not entering the loop and the situation of jumping out of the loop. If some of the pre-conditions are also loop invariant, you need to add them to your answer as well.
Use '&&', '||', '==>', '\forall' or '\exists' if necessary. For instance:
```
loop invariant 1 <= x;
loop invariant x == y;
loop invariant 0 < x ==> y <= z;
loop invariant z % 2 == 1 || x == y;
loop invariant z % 2 == 1 && x <= y;
loop invariant \forall integer k;  0 <= k < i ==> max >=  a[k];
loop invariant \exists integer k;  0 <= k < i &&  max == a[k];
loop invariant \forall integer p; 0 <= p < \at(k, End_l) ==> res[p] == \at(res[p], End_l);
```
Your answer should follow the following format:
```
loop invariant ...;
loop invariant ...;
...
```
No explanation. No commentary. Just show me the loop invariant.

[Unprovable Invariant] 0 <= i < degree
The above loop invariant of loop "A" fails the preservation (inductive) condition:
after executing one iteration of the loop body, the invariant cannot be re-established.
[Loop Body]
res = coeff[i] + x * res; i--;
This failure indicates that the current invariant may be incorrect or incomplete.  
There are two typical causes:
  1) The invariant is logically incorrect, so it does not hold after the loop body executes once.
     - In this case, you must adjust the invariant so that it is preserved by the loop body.
  2) The invariant is insufficient, i.e., it misses essential supporting conditions needed to re-establish itself.
     - In this case, you must introduce additional invariants so that the whole set becomes inductive.
Your task is to produce the corrected and/or auxiliary invariants that make the preservation step succeed.
IMPORTANT RULES:
1. You MUST NOT output any of the original invariants already in the code. Only output the new or modified invariants.
2. All invariants you produce must satisfy:
   - Establishment: they hold on loop entry.
   - Preservation: after executing the loop body exactly once, the invariant still holds.
   - Zero-iteration case: the invariant is valid even if the loop never executes.
3. The answer must follow this format exactly:
   ```
   loop invariant ...;
   loop invariant ...;
   ...
   ```
4. All invariants must follow ACSL syntax and be valid loop invariants.
5. No explanation. No commentary. Just show me the loop invariant.

[Unprovable Invariant] 0 <= i < degree
The above loop invariant of loop "A" fails the preservation (inductive) condition:
after executing one iteration of the loop body, the invariant cannot be re-established.
[Loop Body]
res = coeff[i] + x * res; i--;
This failure indicates that the current invariant may be incorrect or incomplete.  
There are two typical causes:
  1) The invariant is logically incorrect, so it does not hold after the loop body executes once.
     - In this case, you must adjust the invariant so that it is preserved by the loop body.
  2) The invariant is insufficient, i.e., it misses essential supporting conditions needed to re-establish itself.
     - In this case, you must introduce additional invariants so that the whole set becomes inductive.
Your task is to produce the corrected and/or auxiliary invariants that make the preservation step succeed.
IMPORTANT RULES:
1. You MUST NOT output any of the original invariants already in the code. Only output the new or modified invariants.
2. All invariants you produce must satisfy:
   - Establishment: they hold on loop entry.
   - Preservation: after executing the loop body exactly once, the invariant still holds.
   - Zero-iteration case: the invariant is valid even if the loop never executes.
3. The answer must follow this format exactly:
   ```
   loop invariant ...;
   loop invariant ...;
   ...
   ```
4. All invariants must follow ACSL syntax and be valid loop invariants.
5. No explanation. No commentary. Just show me the loop invariant.

   - Zero-iteration case: the invariant is valid even if the loop never executes.

[Unprovable Invariant] \forall integer k; i < k <= degree ==> res == coeff[k] + x * poly_val2(coeff, k+1, degree, x)
The above loop invariant of loop "A" fails the preservation (inductive) condition:
after executing one iteration of the loop body, the invariant cannot be re-established.
[Loop Body]
res = coeff[i] + x * res; i--;
This failure indicates that the current invariant may be incorrect or incomplete.  
There are two typical causes:
  1) The invariant is logically incorrect, so it does not hold after the loop body executes once.
     - In this case, you must adjust the invariant so that it is preserved by the loop body.
  2) The invariant is insufficient, i.e., it misses essential supporting conditions needed to re-establish itself.
     - In this case, you must introduce additional invariants so that the whole set becomes inductive.
Your task is to produce the corrected and/or auxiliary invariants that make the preservation step succeed.
IMPORTANT RULES:
1. You MUST NOT output any of the original invariants already in the code. Only output the new or modified invariants.
2. All invariants you produce must satisfy:
   - Establishment: they hold on loop entry.
   - Preservation: after executing the loop body exactly once, the invariant still holds.
   - Zero-iteration case: the invariant is valid even if the loop never executes.
3. The answer must follow this format exactly:
   ```
   loop invariant ...;
   loop invariant ...;
   ...
   ```
4. All invariants must follow ACSL syntax and be valid loop invariants.
5. No explanation. No commentary. Just show me the loop invariant.
