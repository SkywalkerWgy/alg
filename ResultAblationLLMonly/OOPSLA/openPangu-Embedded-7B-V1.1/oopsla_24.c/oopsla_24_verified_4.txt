But the hint location is in loop B, and the user has already provided the invariants in the comment. But perhaps the user wants me to verify or confirm these invariants. But the user says "generate loop invariant", so perhaps they want me to generate it again. But in the comment, it's already there. Wait, the user's message is in the context of the previous analysis, but the actual task is to generate the loop invariant for the loop indicated by the hint, which is loop B. And the user wants the invariant in ACSL format. Looking at the comment: // Loop B /*@ [Hint] Please infer the loop invariant for the following loop. loop assigns j,k;

   55 |             loop invariant i_76: i <= j <= k", which is the same as this. So for loop B, the invariants are correct. But the user's question is to generate the loop invariant for the loop indicated by the hint, which is loop B. And the inverter for loop B should be the invariants for loop B. But the user says "generate loop invariant as C annotation comments at the hint location (annotated by "[Hint] Please infer the loop invariant for the following loop.") using ACSL language." So I need to output the invariants for loop B in ACSL format. So the invariants for loop B are: loop invariant 0 <= i < n;
