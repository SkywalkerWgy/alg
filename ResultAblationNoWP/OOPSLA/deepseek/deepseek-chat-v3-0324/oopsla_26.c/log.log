You are an expert in program verification, and please generate loop invariant as C annotation comments at the hint location (annotated by "[Hint] Please infer the loop invariant for the following loop.") using ACSL language.
ACSL is a specification language for C programs that conforms to the design by contract paradigm, utilizing Hoare style pre- and postconditions and invariants. Note that the `loop invariant` clause is a condition that is true at the beginning and end of every loop iteration.
Specifically, for the current verification task:
    - Pre-condition: the function's `requires` clauses
    - Post-condition: 
Please verify that the generated loop invariant is consistent with these constraints. If these specific pre- or post-conditions are not provided or empty, please infer the loop invariant strictly based on the program's execution logic and standard correctness.
In order to get a correct answer, You may want to consider both the situation of not entering the loop and the situation of jumping out of the loop. If some of the pre-conditions are also loop invariant, you need to add them to your answer as well.
Use '&&', '||', '==>', '\forall' or '\exists' if necessary. For instance:
```
loop invariant 1 <= x;
loop invariant x == y;
loop invariant 0 < x ==> y <= z;
loop invariant z % 2 == 1 || x == y;
loop invariant z % 2 == 1 && x <= y;
loop invariant \forall integer k;  0 <= k < i ==> max >=  a[k];
loop invariant \exists integer k;  0 <= k < i &&  max == a[k];
loop invariant \forall integer p; 0 <= p < \at(k, End_l) ==> res[p] == \at(res[p], End_l);
```
Your answer should follow the following format:
```
loop invariant ...;
loop invariant ...;
...
```
No explanation. No commentary. Just show me the loop invariant.

You are an expert in program verification, and please generate loop invariant as C annotation comments at the hint location (annotated by "[Hint] Please infer the loop invariant for the following loop.") using ACSL language.
ACSL is a specification language for C programs that conforms to the design by contract paradigm, utilizing Hoare style pre- and postconditions and invariants. Note that the `loop invariant` clause is a condition that is true at the beginning and end of every loop iteration.
Specifically, for the current verification task:
    - Pre-condition: i_11:x == y; i_12:w == z + 1; 
    - Post-condition: i_13:x == y; i_14:w == z + 1; 
Please verify that the generated loop invariant is consistent with these constraints. If these specific pre- or post-conditions are not provided or empty, please infer the loop invariant strictly based on the program's execution logic and standard correctness.
In order to get a correct answer, You may want to consider both the situation of not entering the loop and the situation of jumping out of the loop. If some of the pre-conditions are also loop invariant, you need to add them to your answer as well.
Use '&&', '||', '==>', '\forall' or '\exists' if necessary. For instance:
```
loop invariant 1 <= x;
loop invariant x == y;
loop invariant 0 < x ==> y <= z;
loop invariant z % 2 == 1 || x == y;
loop invariant z % 2 == 1 && x <= y;
loop invariant \forall integer k;  0 <= k < i ==> max >=  a[k];
loop invariant \exists integer k;  0 <= k < i &&  max == a[k];
loop invariant \forall integer p; 0 <= p < \at(k, End_l) ==> res[p] == \at(res[p], End_l);
```

You are an expert in program verification, and please generate loop invariant as C annotation comments at the hint location (annotated by "[Hint] Please infer the loop invariant for the following loop.") using ACSL language.
ACSL is a specification language for C programs that conforms to the design by contract paradigm, utilizing Hoare style pre- and postconditions and invariants. Note that the `loop invariant` clause is a condition that is true at the beginning and end of every loop iteration.
Specifically, for the current verification task:
    - Pre-condition: 
    - Post-condition: i_30:w % 2 == 1; i_31:z % 2 == 0; i_32:x == y; 
Please verify that the generated loop invariant is consistent with these constraints. If these specific pre- or post-conditions are not provided or empty, please infer the loop invariant strictly based on the program's execution logic and standard correctness.
In order to get a correct answer, You may want to consider both the situation of not entering the loop and the situation of jumping out of the loop. If some of the pre-conditions are also loop invariant, you need to add them to your answer as well.
Use '&&', '||', '==>', '\forall' or '\exists' if necessary. For instance:
```
loop invariant 1 <= x;
loop invariant x == y;
loop invariant 0 < x ==> y <= z;
loop invariant z % 2 == 1 || x == y;
loop invariant z % 2 == 1 && x <= y;
loop invariant \forall integer k;  0 <= k < i ==> max >=  a[k];
loop invariant \exists integer k;  0 <= k < i &&  max == a[k];
loop invariant \forall integer p; 0 <= p < \at(k, End_l) ==> res[p] == \at(res[p], End_l);
```
Your answer should follow the following format:
```

No explanation. No commentary. Just show me the loop invariant.
