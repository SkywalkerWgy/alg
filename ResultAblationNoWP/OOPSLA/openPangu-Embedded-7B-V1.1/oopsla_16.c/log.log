You are an expert in program verification, and please generate loop invariant as C annotation comments at the hint location (annotated by "[Hint] Please infer the loop invariant for the following loop.") using ACSL language.
ACSL is a specification language for C programs that conforms to the design by contract paradigm, utilizing Hoare style pre- and postconditions and invariants. Note that the `loop invariant` clause is a condition that is true at the beginning and end of every loop iteration.
Specifically, for the current verification task:
    - Pre-condition: the function's `requires` clauses
    - Post-condition: a_1:i == j ==> y == 0; 
Please verify that the generated loop invariant is consistent with these constraints. If these specific pre- or post-conditions are not provided or empty, please infer the loop invariant strictly based on the program's execution logic and standard correctness.
In order to get a correct answer, You may want to consider both the situation of not entering the loop and the situation of jumping out of the loop. If some of the pre-conditions are also loop invariant, you need to add them to your answer as well.
Use '&&', '||', '==>', '\forall' or '\exists' if necessary. For instance:
```
loop invariant 1 <= x;
loop invariant x == y;
loop invariant 0 < x ==> y <= z;
loop invariant z % 2 == 1 || x == y;
loop invariant z % 2 == 1 && x <= y;
loop invariant \forall integer k;  0 <= k < i ==> max >=  a[k];
loop invariant \exists integer k;  0 <= k < i &&  max == a[k];
loop invariant \forall integer p; 0 <= p < \at(k, End_l) ==> res[p] == \at(res[p], End_l);

[unused16][unused17]loop invariant x == y;
loop invariant x >= 0 && y >= 0;
```

Example usage:

```
loop invariant x == y;
```

When the loop condition is `x != 0`, the loop invariant `x == y` implies that both `x` and `y` are either zero or non-zero together. However, if `x` and `y` can differ within the loop (e.g., `x` and `y` are unrelated variables), this invariant would not hold. The invariant `x == y` must be refined or removed if `x` and `y` are not supposed to be equal in the loop. 

If `x` and `y` are supposed to be unrelated but both must decrease together (e.g., as counters), a stronger invariant like `x >= y` could be considered instead.

### Explanation:
- The loop invariant `x == y` directly reflects the hint's instruction to infer the invariant based on `loop assigns x;` and `loop assigns y;`.
- Additional invariants `x >= 0 && y >= 0` are added to ensure termination (since `x` and `y` are uninitialized, their values are unbounded and could violate termination).
- The invariant is valid because:
  - At loop entry: `x == y` (from initialization and assignment).
  - At loop exit: `x == y` (after decrementing both, they remain equal if they started equal).
- The invariant is not "strengthened" further because no additional invariant is needed for the provided assertion. The invariant `x == y` is sufficient for the given postcondition. 

If you have additional constraints (e.g., `x` and `y` must not equal, or must remain equal but with other invariants), the invariant would change accordingly. For example:

#### If `x` and `y` must not equal:
```
loop invariant x != y;
```

#### If `x` and `y` must remain equal but must not be zero:
```
loop invariant x == y && x != 0;
```

#### If `x` and `y` are unrelated but must both decrease:
```
loop invariant x >= y;
```

Would you like to refine the invariant further based on additional constraints? For example, if `x` and `y` must not be zero or must remain equal but with additional conditions? Let me know how to adjust the invariant accordingly.
