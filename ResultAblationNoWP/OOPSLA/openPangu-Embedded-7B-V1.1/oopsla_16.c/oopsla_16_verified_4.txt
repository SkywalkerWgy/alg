   23 |         loop invariant i_11: `x == y` implies that both `x` and `y` are either zero or non-zero together. However, if `x` and `y` can differ within the loop (e.g., `x` and `y` are unrelated variables), this invariant would not hold. The invariant `x == y` must be refined or removed if `x` and `y` are not supposed to be equal in the loop. If `x` and `y` are supposed to be unrelated but both must decrease together (e.g., as counters), a stronger invariant like `x >= y` could be considered instead. ### Explanation: - The loop invariant `x == y` directly reflects the hint's instruction to infer the invariant based on `loop assigns x;
