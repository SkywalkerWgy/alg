   66 |                 loop invariant i_57: for the innermost loop (Loop C) should be derived based on the loop's iteration constraints and the behavior of the loop body. Given the loop structure of the innermost loop: ```c for (k=j;k<n;k++) ``` We can observe that the loop starts with `k = j` and increments `k` until `k < n`. Therefore, at the end of each iteration, `k` will be equal to `n`. However, in the provided code, there is a comment indicating an assertion that `k>=i` within the loop body. This suggests that the loop invariant might also need to ensure `k>=i` to satisfy this assertion. Considering these observations, the loop invariant for the innermost loop (Loop C) should include both the basic loop invariant (`k < n`) and the additional invariant that `k>=i` to satisfy the assertion inside the loop. Therefore, the loop invariant for Loop C would be: ``` loop invariant k < n && k >= i;

   94 |                 loop invariant i_71: s, which are simple conditions, we can just use `k < n` if we know `k >= i` is maintained by the loop structure. But since the assertion is `k>=i`, it's safer to include it. However, the original code has `//@ assert a_1: k>=i;

  104 |                 loop invariant i_76: must be a condition that holds before and after each iteration, and `k >= i` holds before the iteration (because `k = j >= i`), and after the iteration, `k == n >= i` (since `i` is unchanged), so it holds after too. So, the invariant `k >= i` holds before and after each iteration. Similarly, `k < n` holds before each iteration, but after each iteration, `k == n`, so `k < n` does not hold after. Therefore, the only invariant that holds after each iteration is `k == n`. But the invariant is supposed to hold at the end of the iteration, not necessarily after. The invariant is: - Before iteration: condition P - After iteration: condition P' In ACSL, the loop invariant is a single condition that is true before and after each iteration. So, for Loop C: - Before iteration: `k >= i && k < n` - After iteration: `k == n` But the invariant clause is a single condition that is true before and after each iteration. So, we can write: ``` loop invariant k >= i && k < n;
