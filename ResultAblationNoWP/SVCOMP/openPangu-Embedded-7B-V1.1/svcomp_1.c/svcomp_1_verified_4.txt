    8 |         loop invariant i_17: is inferred purely based on the program logic and standard correctness requirements for loop invariants. The loop invariant is `y < 1000`, which must hold true before and after each iteration of the loop. The variable `x` is updated using `y`, but since `y` is incremented in each iteration, `y < 1000` is the invariant that constrains the loop's termination condition. The invariant `x >= y` is not guaranteed at the end of the loop (since the loop exits when `y == 1000`, and `x` may be `y + sum of all previous y values`), so it cannot be part of the loop invariant. If pre- or post-conditions were provided (e.g., `requires` or `assert` clauses), the invariant would be adjusted accordingly. Since they are not present in the code snippet, only the standard loop invariant is provided. **Note:** The loop invariant is placed in ACSL as follows: ```acsl loop invariant && y < 1000;
